                    The Problem & Our Human-Centred Approach
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The presence of arsenic(As)in drinking-water is a major concern to human health due to the diseases it could cause, considered a group 1 carcinogen for humans. (1,2). According to Ormachea et.al.(2016)(3), the presence of As in water, mainly in groundwater, is due to natural geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities such as mining which started in the 16th century severely impacting quality of wáter and soils around mines with large discharges of acid mine drainage and high concentrations of metals and metalloids such as Arsenic. Studies in Bolivia assessing this issue have shown that water from shallow wells (up to 30 m), used for human consumption, have As concentrations 25 times the Bolivian standard and the WHO recommendation (10 μg / L).(4) Besides, bolivian women showed an elevated exposure to As and an efficient metabolism for it. (5)
                </p>
                <p>
                    As human practices we wanted to integrate all social actors involved in issues of access to water quality and sanitation, we carried out activities related to ethics, sustainability and safety. Our main objective was to learn about the problem of arsenic contamination in our country, to reach the populations where the presence of this metal was evidenced and to propose possible solutions. We were very interested in visiting a rural community so we interviewed professional experts on the subject and reviewed the pertinent bibliography, thus evidencing the presence of arsenic in the water in several regions of the Bolivian Altiplano, knowing the degree and type of contamination, our access and contact with them. We received feedback about the problem, guidance in our project, advice for our activities and suggestions based on their experience with communities, always considering aspects that are quite evident in the Bolivian situation. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The general population has a bad perception about promoting science in Bolivia because of historical antecedents. As well as that, bad information provokes a bad perception about it. Technologies and innovations began to be demonized, making its process difficult. In addition, the lack of commitment of many scientists who worked in rural communities caused them to feel used, affected in their culture and beliefs. To regain their trust, invest time and showing results and solutions was important, knowing that this would be a process.

                    Designing Our Human Practices Framework
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We were able to work on this analysis with the help of experts from different areas (anthropology, sociology and agronomy). At this point, we had to measure priorities and possibilities, giving up for the moment, the idea of visiting a rural community due to social, cultural aspects and the time factor.    We had in mind that Human Practices is an area linked to a lot of perspective related to the needs of those affected and our activities were guided to cover these needs, without forgetting that at some point we plan to continue with our project and we will be able to work and dedicate the deserved time to rural communities, extinguishing that skeptical gap in face of synthetic biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore we continued with the research and finally made our decision. One of the papers that helped us to know more about the arsenic problem was the "Water Chemistry of Arsenic Naturally Produced in Underground Water in Cochabamba - Bolivia”. In this work, 18 water samples from wells were studied, which had supplied water to 11 urban communities in the lower valley of Cochabamba. Arsenic concentrations ranged from values below the detection limit, 3 μg/L, to a maximum of 581.7 μg/L. Up to 55.6% of the wells studied presented As concentrations above the maximum allowable value. A peri-urban community with the presence of arsenic turns out to be more accessible to us so, after analyzing, we decided to elaborate a survey and interview local authorities from 5 different communities to know their opinion about the presence of arsenic in their water sources and to have their approval regarding the survey. At the same time, we provided information on biotechnology and synthetic biology to know their position on these topics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We know that genetic engineering falls within the limits of the bioethical dilemmas. The precautionary principle generates panic in a population that is poorly informed and easily manipulated. Critical thinking was our best tool and dialogue with institutions was the ultimate strategy. Winning the recognition of iGEM will allow the iGEM Bolivia team to establish a precedent in Bolivia and show that we can impact our country and change the historical course.

                Our Human Practices Journey
            </h3>
            <p>
                The dynamics between the public perception and the attempt to introduce and explain our project within the problem caused by the presence of arsenic or contamination were a real challenge. This is why we decided to contact different experts in areas such as: economics, sociology and engineering. We had these interviews in virtual meetings from March to August. This helped us to understand and decide which approach was best to focus on in order to succeed with our project.

                        <p>Doctor Ledo, an economist specialized in water with a focus on social issues, accepted an interview with the purpose of learning about her experience as an economist. Her socio-economic work on the water master plan in the city of Cochabamba has the relevance of having found and related lead as an abortive factor in the population in the southern area of Cochabamba. It was argued that, given the scarcity of water supply, people have been adopting their own measures for it. She described the vulnerability of the inhabitants of the city of Cochabamba reflected in terms of life expectancy in some areas of the city. In terms of cost, these are variable from region to region. Thus, even the money allocated for the abductions would be insufficient to meet the high needs of the city of Cochabamba.</p>

                        <p>Doctor Tirado is a biochemist and has worked with more than 10 rural communities affected by high concentrations of arsenic in the Altiplanic region of Bolivia. Considering what doctor Ledo mentioned to us about the water problems in Cochabamba we decided on this interview. She told us about her work with arsenic and it’s genotoxicity. The communities she worked with were surrounding the area of Popó Lake, on the highlands. She and her team collected samples of water that had higher arsenic concentration. She reminded us the importance of being able to dialogue with rural community members and helped us to enter into the context of integration work with anthropological work where various parts of the culture needed to be reviewed, other aspects should be analyzed such as age, people’s percentage of inhabitants  and interest on the part of female community members. It should be noted that she identified that the community members had deeper social needs.</p>

                        <p>Mister Peñafiel is an agronomist who worked in rural communities whose main income came from gold mining. After doctor Tirados’s experience, we decided to inquire more on visiting rural communities, so we had an interview with mister Peñafiel. He told us his experience by giving us some advice such as what strategies we should have taken to approach the neighbors of the rural communities, since he saw that these people had already been offered other projects but unfortunately it didn’t end well and they concluded that these projects only showed them the problem without solutions. This is why, he suggested that if we were going to show them the arsenic biosensor project, we would have to give a solution. Other advice he gave us was to talk first with the ones in charge of the rural community, use simple words while speaking and try to speak the language they did.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Ormachea is a specialist in arsenic geochemistry. When we met to talk about arsenic in Bolivia, we managed to understand that different parameters had to be taken into account in order to develop our biosensor.
                            He talked to us about how to measure the degree of impact on rural peri-urban communities affected by the presence of arsenic, as well as the pros and cons involved in detecting heavy metals in drinking water, since water as such, not only comes with the presence of heavy metals, but also with organic matter and other elements. 
                            This made us reflect that we should focus on visiting the most populated communities and look for an adequate solution.

                        <p>The next step we took was having an interview with students of anthropology and archaeology. As we were determined to visit rural communities, a manual of how to visit rural communities was about to be carried out with help of these students, with the purpose of developing valuable information for future participation in iGEM. However, they warned us that people from these communities shouldn’t be treated like study objects since they would have been the protagonists of the project. They also mentioned that the team must have lived the cultural experience of each community, therefore only 2 months was not ideal for a study in the social area. This is why, we realized that visiting a rural community would have been really difficult and laborious to be done successfully.

                        <p>Taking into account all the points the anthropology students talked about and reviewing the documents again, we realized that we could reorient our proposal. So we made the decision to contact the Bolivian Public University (UPB  in Spanish) and the Bolivian organization AGUATUYA. We met with four professionals: Ramiro Escalera, PhD., Renato Montoya, BEng., Ivette Echeverria, BEng. and Oliver Saavedra, BEng. Regarding UPB, they have been investigating arsenic, its detection and remediation, since 2011. So they told us more about the previous sampling campaign and updated the well data. The data update was done in another sampling campaign in 2019 where they added new wells from nearby urban communities.. To detect arsenic, they used the hydride generation method combined with the atomic absorption spectrophotometry method. In the analytical processes they carried out, they introduced a reagent that converts arsenic 5 to 3 so that the spectrophotometer can give quantitative and real results. AGUATUYA performs water quality monitoring and control in the wastewater treatment plants. To know the quality of the water obtained from these plants, they used fish as indicators. However, the heavy metals in these waters do not undergo any transformation in terms of biological treatment. The treatment plants play an important role as these waters can be used for irrigation only.

                        <p>A very important center based in Cochabamba, also mentioned in the papers and in the meeting with UPB, is CASA (Centro de Aguas y Saneamiento Ambiental - Water and Environmental Sanitation Center), which works with water analysis and environmental sanitation. In the meeting we had, together with the human practices team, three professionals from this center were present: Ana Maria Romero, PhD., Carla Oporto, PhD. and Mercedes Iriarte, PhD. CASA specializes in the analysis of different metals due to their toxicity and mainly in waters of mineralized areas or with mining activity in the highlands of the country. According to their experience, in Cochabamba there is no evidence of heavy metal concentrations exceeding the levels generally permitted in drinking water or wastewater. However, an in-depth study of arsenic concentrations in wells has not been carried out, so there isn't a routine detection of arsenic in water, they mentioned the atomic absorption technique in a graphite furnace and also the optical Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry technique (mostly used for soil samples) as arsenic detection methods. In describing this situation to us, the doctors recommended that we contact Ramiro Escalera. Finally, they told us a bit about their experience with well sampling, offering us help on taking the samples correctly so that our concentration determination results were reliable when validating our project.
